(oleexp 6.3 - Released 09 June 2023)
-Added active scripting interfaces (ActivScp.h)
-Completed Core Audio interfaces
-Added Package Manager interfaces from msopc.idl/coclass OpcFactory

-(Bug fix) VB6 did not play nice with Implements where one argument was an HRESULT.
-(Bug fix) D3D11CreateDevice pFeatureLevels now As Any to allow passing ByVal 0. 
-(Bug fix) DirectComposition vtable ordering to correct undocumented vtable reversal.

(oleexp 6.2 - Released 01 April 2023)
-Added accessibility UI Automation interfaces and APIs. 
  NOTE: This API had a number of *very* generically named enums, like FillMode and ToggleState; these have been prefixed with Uia_ to avoid conflicts. In most cases, the actual members were left   alone, with the exception of LiveSetting (renamed Uia_LiveSetting), which had Off, Polite, and Assertive; these have been prefixed with Uia_ as well.
  NOTE: IUIAutomationAndCondition and IUIAutomationOrCondition have members that return a SAFEARRAY of IUIAutomationCondition... MKTYPLIB does not support this so these return a pointer you'll need to dereference.
-Completed Media Foundation interfaces up through the most recent Windows 11 SDK. This includes the capture engine and other entirely new feature sets.
-Added CoreAudio Spatial Audio interfaces (newer Win10 versions/Win11 only)
-Added IActiveScript and all related ActiveX Script Host / Engine interfaces.
-Added IPinnedList (Vista), IPinnedList2 (7 < Win10 1809), IPinnedList3 (>= Win10 1809), and coclass TaskBandPin. Added IStartMenuPin. Don't abuse these-- always ask user permission to pin.
-Added ITrayNotify and INotificationCB, coclass TrayNotify
-Added coclass TaskBand
-Added IHandlerInfo2, IDeskBar, IDeskBarClient amd IShellFolderBand
-Added IHostDialogHelper, coclass HostDialogHelper

-(mIID) Added EP_* GUIDs for IExplorerPaneVisibility
-(mIID) Added some missing SID_ guids.
-Bug fix: AUDCLNT_RETURNCODES were all incorrect.

(oleexp 6.1 - Released 02 March 2023)
-Added ITrayBand, IDeskBand2, IDeskBandInfo, IBandHost, and IBandSite interfaces, IMenuBand, and coclasses TrayDeskBand, TrayBandSiteServices
-Added IRegTreeItem interface
-Added IPrintDialogCallback/IPrintDialogServices interfaces.
-Bug fix: Certain DirectWrite interface members had ByRef Long for strings where they should have had ByVal.
-Bug fix: SHELLSTATE had an extra member on the end (shouldn't have impacted use, but if MS changed the API to look for an exact size it would be an issue).
-Bug fix: Attempted to correct INameSpaceTreeControlEvents context menu crashing.

(oleexp 6.0 - Released 26 February 2023)
-Added WebView2 interfaces/types/enums.
-Added Microsoft Speech APIs Version 5.4
-Added IHttpNegotiate3, IObjectProvider, IEnumObjects, and IIOCancelInformation interfaces.
-Added Vista+ PROPSHEETPAGE and PROPSHEETHEADER versions of these structs (use PROPSHEETPAGE_V4 and PROPSHEETHEADER_V2 on Vista+) and PropSheet/PropSheetW APIs. Also corrected wrong values for PSN_TRANSLATEACCELERATOR/PSN_QUERYINITIALFOCUS.
-(Bug fix) StringFromGUID2 now uses a Long instead of LPWSTR since the latter was not working.


(oleexp 5.6 - Released 16 February 2023)
-Added all missing Direct2D interfaces/types/enums.
-Added all Direct3D 11 and 12 interfaces/types/enums.
-(mDirectX) Bug fix: Many functions not returning GUIDs.

(oleexp 5.5 - Released 12 February 2023)
-Added objidl.idl interfaces IAdviseSink2, IClientSecurity, IServerSecurity, IMallocSpy, IClassActivator, IProgressNotify, IStdMarshalInfo, IExternalConnection and IThumbnailExtractor (w/coclass ThumbnailFCNHandler).
-Added undocmented hardware enum interfaces/coclasses.
-Bug fix: ICreateTypeLib2 incorrectly extended IUnknown instead of ICreateTypeLib.

(oleexp 5.4 - Released 09 February 2023)
-Added DXGI and DirectComposition interfaces
-Substantially expanded included Media Foundation interfaces. This includes all the related GUIDs defined in mfidl.idl, in DirectX.bas, in addition to the interface IIDs.
-(Bug fix) IMFMediaTypes had ByVal UDTs
-(Bug fix) IShellWindows had member with VARIANT instead of VARIANT_BOOL.
-(Bug fix) ITypeInfo had the wrong GUID, which is incredible as it's been wrong since the original olelib.


(oleexp 5.3 - Released 05 February 2023)
-Integrated The trick's DirectWrite and Direct2D type libraries. The trick's dwvb_impl.tlb (DirectWrite for Implements) has been added to oleexpimp.tlb. Note: These had to be converted from MIDL to MKTYPLIB; this conversion may be imperfect. Please report any issues. You can build a version of oleexp without these by commenting out the #include statements for exp_dw.odl amd exp_d2d.odl in oleexp.odl.
-New addon module mDirectX.bas contains IIDs for DirectWrite/Direct2D.
-Added Sync Manager interfaces and coclasses (SyncMgr.h), including undocumented ITransferConfirmation/coclass TransferConfirmationUI.
-Added windowless RichEdit related interfaces ITextServices, ITextServices2, ITextHost, ITextHost2.
-Added interfaces IPersistSerializedPropStorage, IPersistSerializedPropStorage2, and IPropertySystemChangeNotify
-Added missing propsys coclasses CLSID_InMemoryPropertyStore, CLSID_InMemoryPropertyStoreMarshalByValue, CLSID_PropertySystem
-Added IShellUIHelper[2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9], IShellFavoritesNameSpace, IShellNameSpace, IScriptErrorList and related coclasses.

-Added Implements-compatible IFolderViewSettings to oleeximp.tlb.
-Bug fix: CreateTypeLib definition incorrect (had LPWSTR* instead of LPWSTR)
-(oleexmpimp) Bug fix: IFolderView2::SetViewProperty incorrectly had a ByVal VARIANT that should be ByRef.

(oleexp 5.1 - Released 05 November 2022)
-Several interfaces from shell automation were missing or only located in oleexpimp
-Added ISecurityInformation[2, 3, 4]/CreateSecurityPage API interfaces
-Added Windows Search API interfaces

(oleexp 5.03 - Released 20 October 2022)
-Added IHWEventHandler2 and IDynamicHWHandler interfaces
-(Bug fix) IShellTaskScheduler::CountTasks was incorrect and ::Status was missing.
-Misc oscure bug fixes
-(oleexpimp) Critical bug fix: Apparently, when oleeximp is compiled, MKTYPLIB favors the oleexp.tlb (imported) in SysWOW64 over the current directory. This resulted in a subtle mismatch causing 'Unexpected error (32810)' when implementing certain interfaces, even though the interface definitions themselves hadn't changed at all.

(oleexp 5.02 - Released 13 September 2022)
-Added missing oaidl interfaces ITypeMarshal, ITypeLibRegistration, ITypeLibRegistrationReader, ITypeChangeEvents, and ITypeMarshal.
-ICategoryProvider.CanCategorizeOnSCID needs to provide return value when used as a consumer. The all-HRESULT version is now in oleexpimp.tlb for providers.
-Added FILEOP_FLAGSEX with the FOFX_ values; this were already in the IFO_Flags enum with a custom prefix for displaying a combined enum for IFileOperation without showing them for SHFileOperation, but I thought they should also exist under the documented names.
-A few misc bug fixes to rarely used interfaces.
-Added a public LongPtr type; it's just an alias for Long but the idea is to enable writing code that can reused in 64bit VBA or twinBASIC.
-(oleexpimp) Added Implements-compatible versions of IPreviewHandler, IInitializeWithStream, IInitializeWithItem, and IInitializeWithFile for use in creating preview handler shell extensions.

(oleexp 5.01 - Released 16 June 2022)
-While I don't recall precisely why I put the incomplete set of shell32 automation interfaces in oleexpimp.tlb instead of oleexp.tlb, since there was no conflict, this situation has been rectified and there's now a *complete* copy of shell32 automation interfaces, with all exposed publicly rather than some hidden, in oleexp.tlb as well. They're still in oleexpimp as to not break compatibility.

(oleexp 5.0 - Released 28 May 2022)
-oleexp now includes all calls neccessary for TLB-based multithreading. Multithreading methods by The trick and Matthew Curland (PowerVB) have all calls included. For the latter, calls to the CreateThread API may need to be adjusted by pass ByVal, especially ByVal 0& for the LPSECURITY_ATTRIBUTES.
    Note: As with any multithreading with TLB project, you'll need to be careful you don't have any functions used by the multithreading code declared as Public in your project, as those will always have higher priority than a TLB.
-Added IInertiaProcessor, IManipulationProcessor, and IManipulationEvents interfaces with coclasses InertiaProcessor and ManipulationProcessor (for advanced handling of touch input). While these types are already in an addable reference, one uses unsigned longs, making that version incompatible with VB.
-Added interface IShellIconOverlayManager and coclass CFSIconOverlayManager
-Added SysReAllocStringW alias for SysReAllocString that supports a StrPtr pointer to properly support Unicode, finally relieving the need for a separate API declare for the LPWStrToStr function ubiquitous in oleexp projects (provided you add the W; I didn't want to break backwards compatibility by replacing the original). 
-Added ILVRange undocumented ListView interface. This one was *really* undocumented; I was the first to publicly document it: 
   https://www.vbforums.com/showthread.php?895324-Undocumented-undocumented-ListView-LVM_SETRANGEOBJECT-and-ILVRange
-Added interface IShellRunDll; Implements-compatible.
-Updated SIIGBF and various other enums with flags introduced in Windows 8 or 10
-Created enum for SFVM_*... these were previously just commented out in source..
-For CoreAudio, REFERENCE_TIME and HNSTIME are now a public type alias for Currency (take care when using it).
-(Bug fix) Due to some trolling from Microsoft, IAudioClient has several members the public headers and topline documentation declare as WAVEFORMATEX. But in the fine print, you find this is a lie. They actually use WAVEFORMATEXTENSIBLE, and will not work on many systems without it. Since that was not included in the TLB, it's impossible to use. These methods now use As Any, so if the old way was working on your system, no changes are strictly neccessary (but if you're distributing it, your clients may run into it, so you should change it). This bug triggered releasing a new version now. IPolicyConfig, IPolicyConfigVista, IAudioClient2, and IAudioClient3 were also changed. 
-(Bug fix) AUDIO_VOLUME_NOTIFICATION_DATA only had a single array member for channel volume. It's set to 2 now to get two channel info, but this may change in the future if I figure out how to get 3+ channel info.
-(Bug fix) Finally corrected built-in AssocCreate API from the olelib original. It was missing 4 bytes; a CLSID is 16, but it originally had long short short long, which is 12. Now BYTE[8].
-(Bug fix) ULONG was defined as an unsigned long, but of course anyone trying to use it would get an error. It's now just an alias for a signed long. And no longer public.
-(mPKEY) SCID_DateDeleted and SCID_OriginalLocation don't have PROPERTYKEY defs in the SDK, but can still be passed (and will be received from) any Recycle Bin property store.

(oleexp 4.81 - Released 19 Jan 2022)
-Needed to make a change to IFolderView2.GetSortColumns in both oleexp.tlb and oleexpimp.tlb (now v2.11); passing a long with VarPtr(array(0)) is the only way to work on both the main side and the Implements version together.

(oleexp 4.8 - Released 19 Jan 2022)
-Added newer Internet Security Zone interfaces- IZoneIdentifier2, IInternetSecurityManagerEx, IInternetSecurityManagerEx2, IInternetZoneManagerEx, IInternetZoneManagerEx2, IUri.
-Added coclass InternetZoneManager
-Added Microsoft Media Foundation interfaces, APIs, and types/enums. This is a limited set, not a complete one. 
-Added undocumented interface IShellFolder3 in oleexpimp.tlb, since it's for implementing in namespace extensions.
-Added interface IGlobalInterfaceTable with coclass StdGlobalInterfaceTable
-Added undocumented interfaces IInfoBarMessage, IInfoBarHost, and IBrowserProgressSessionProvider
-(oleexpimp) IShellBrowser had void* types that prevented implementation. Changed to long. Pass a pointer.
-(oleexpimp) Added IWebBrowser, IWebBrowserApp, IShellFolderViewDual, IShellFolderViewDual2, IShellFolderViewDual3, Folder, FolderItem, FolderItems, FolderItemVerb, and FolderItemVerbs.
-(oleexpimp) Added IFolderView, IFolderView2, and IShellView3, which need alternate versions for Implements.
-(oleexpimp) IShellFolder2 and 3 had out only parameters, which are incompatible with Implements (unless as retval).

(oleexp 4.7 - Released 23 Dec 2020)
-Added interfaces IFrameworkInputPaneHandler and IFrameworkInputPane, with coclass FrameworkInputPane.
-Added interface IShellTaskScheduler with coclass ShellTaskScheduler.
-Added interface ISharingConfigurationManager with coclass SharingConfigurationManager.
-Added interface IDefaultFolderMenuInitialize with coclass DefFolderMenu.
-Added interfaces IAccessible, IAccessibleHandler, IAccessibleWindowlessSite, IAccIdentity, IAccPropServer, and IAccPropServices (with coclass CAccPropServices) from oleacc.h, and related consts. 
-Added undocumented interface ICustomizeInfoTip
-Added coclass PropertyChangeArray
-CHANGE TO MAJOR OLELIB INTERFACES: IFolderView has been updated to use As Any in a ByRef Long to get objects in .Items and .GetFolder. Also associated SVGIO enum for several members. Changed ByRef Long for interface pointers in IShellView and IShellView2 .GetItemObject, ICategoryProvider .CreateCategory 
-IPropertyStore.SetValue and .Commit were already functions, made the rest of the methods into one as well.
-Added a number of error/success consts including OLE_E_, REGDB_E_, STG_E_, and RPC_E_ error codes.
-The wmp.dll dependency has been removed from oleexp.tlb, and placed in its own dependent tlb, oleexpwmp.tlb. The source is in \source\wmp\, which just moves the wmp.inc source file from olelib/oleexp and like mimelib.tlb, it's compiled including oleexp.tlb. 
-Bug fix: IItemNameLimits is typically used for Implements, but had out-only parameters making that impossible. 
-Bug fix: IUN_Flags and NII_Flags contained duplicate enum values. This caused an error using any of them and you had to specify which to use. The former has been removed. Change any instance of 'IUN_Flags' to 'NII_Flags'. The values themselves are unchanged.
-Bug fix: After the above issue popped up, I created a tool to root out any further duplicates. Unfortunately, there were many, as I had never worried about this under the assumption that a compile error would be triggered for such a situation.
          The following were fixed: Two SVSI_Flags enums, one with additional values. Two SVGIO_Flags enums, ditto. Full duplicates of SVUIA_STATUS and SV2GV_Flags. ISCM_FLAGS was not used anywhere, and contained only a single value found in MUTZ_FLAGS. The URLACTION enum contained some duplicate values from URLPOLICIES.
-(oleexpimp) oleexpimp.tlb has been recompiled using oleexp 4.63
-(oleexpimp) Bug fix: This used the IShellFolder definition from olelib2, but VB says that's a bad interface for Implements
-(mWIC) Added WebP and Heif container format UUIDs.



(oleexp 4.62 - Released 20 Oct 2019)
-CHANGE TO MAJOR INTERFACE: IShellFolder.SetNameOf has been modified to accept a string as a LONG (via StrPtr) rather than being passed As String, which resulted in garbled text unless you used StrConv(vbUnicode). Previously I do not believe Unicode would work.
-Added all interfaces, types, enums, and consts for Windows Imaging Component. APIs listed in wincodec.idl and wincodecsdk.idl have also been added.
-NEW ADDON: IIDs for WIC, along with a bunch of GUIDs et al. have been placed in a separate module.
-NEW ADDON: mPortableDevices.bas contains a massive number of PROPERTYKEYs and UUIDs for use with the Portable Device interfaces.
-Added additional Portable Device coclasses, structs, and a large number of enums.



(oleexp 4.61 - Released 03 Oct 2019)
-Added all Structured Query interfaces not already added.


(oleexp 4.6 - Released 19 Sep 2019)
-Added additional interfaces for DirectShow: IFilterGraph2, IFilterGraph3, IMediaSample, IMediaSample2, ISampleGrabber, ISampleGrabberCB.
-Added coclasses for DirectShow: FilterGraph for IFilterGraph2, SampleGrabber for ISampleGrabber, and numerous for IBaseFilter (see end of exp_dshow.odl if needed). 
-Added interface IMessageFilter
-Added interface IMultiQI
-IKnownFolderManager now has all members as functions that return an HRESULT, since this interface is not used with Implements.
-Added DV_ERROR enum with all DV_E_ error values (for IDataObject)
-Updated BO_Flags enum (SBSP_ values) with flags added in Win Vista-Win 10
-CM_COLUMNINFO now has mask/state values directly associated so Intellisense lists them. Also associated SHGNO_Flags (SHGDNF) with IShellFolder.[Get|Set]NameOf.
-In the declare for the StgCreateStorageEx API, made optional parameters optional instead of required.
-Bug fix: IShellLibrary.GetFolders was locked to returning an IShellItemArray instead of 'As Any'. IObjectCollection and others can be requested.
-Bug fix: IConditionFactory2 members CreateIntegerLeaf and CreateBooleanLeaf accidentally had a UUID argument passed ByVal. Additionally after a project-wide scan, ICaptureGraphBuilder[2].FindInterface was corrected for this bug; no other occurences were found.
-Bug fix: ICustomDestinationList.BeginList has pcMinSlots as [in] instead of [out]
-Bug fix: Corrected long-standing problem with IExplorerPaneVisibility.GetPaneState; having an out-only param was blocking use with Implements
-Bug fix: STGOPTIONS struct was defined incorrectly, using two Long vars instead of two Integer vars
-(oleexpimp) Some interfaces, like IStream, were resulting in 'Unexpected Error 32810'; recompiling oleexpimp fixed this, so be sure to overwrite yours with the one in this release.
-(Source) The oleexp source zip now contains the project files I use for Visual Studio 2015, so you can open all project files at once easily.



(oleexp 4.5 - Released 01 Aug 2018)
-Added Task Scheduler 2.0 and 3.0 interfaces (1.0 was already present from the original olelib)
-Added interfaces IEnumerableView and IEnumReadyCallback
-Added interface IInitializeNetworkFolder with coclass NetworkPlaces
-Added interface IResultsFolder
-Added interface IVirtualDesktopManager with coclass VirtualDesktopManager (Windows 10 only)
-Updated KF_FLAGS_* enum
-Bug fix: IKnownFolderManager.GetFolderIds contained a VB6-incompatible pointer type. It has been changed to a ByRef Long, giving you a memory pointer you can use with CopyMemory to get the data.
-Bug fix: The project was subsequently scanned for other occurrences of the above bug, and fixed in: INamespaceWalk.GetIDArrayResult, IAudioClient.IsFormatSupported, IAudioClient.GetMixType, IAudioRenderClient.GetBuffer, IHardwareAudioEngineBase.SetEngineDeviceFormat, IPolicyConfig[Vista].GetMixFormat, IPolicyConfig[Vista].GetDeviceFormat, IViewObject.GetColorSet, IAMCertifiedOutputProtection.KeyExchange, IShellImageData.CloneFrame
-(mIID) Added many new FOLDERID_ values for Win8/10
-(mCoreAudio) Added additional PKEYs



(oleexp 4.43 - Released 18 May 2018)
-Added SpellCheck interfaces (Win8+)
-Added newer values for FILE_ATTRIBUTES



(oleexp v4.42 - Released 13 Apr 2018)
Note: 4.41 was a limited release; not rolling the version number backwards from the current builds.
-The decision has been made to merge the Undocumented ListView typelib into oleexp. The ListView is part of the shell. 
--This is a full merge, meaning that the types used have been standardized. LGUID is now UUID, LPROPKEY is now PROPERTYKEY, and the 'tag' designation has been removed from ListView types.
--The ListView structures provided are only those used in the interfaces, not a complete set.



(oleexp v4.4 - Released 16 Mar 2018)
-Added interfaces IPropertyDescriptionAliasInfo, INamedPropertyStore
-Added interface IPersistFolder3
-Added interface INewMenuClient
-Added interface IItemNameLimits

-Added SystemMetrics enum for GetSystemMetrics and added the API itself with the enum tagged for the popup list of values
-Duplicated PROGDLG enum in OPPROGDLG for ease of use
-(Bug fix) IPropertyDescription contained an invalid entry (RemoteCoerceToCanonicalValue) that broke FormatForDisplay and IsValueCanonical (due to bad vtable order)
-(Bug fix) IPropertyChange, IPropertyEnumTypeList, IPropertySystem, and IPropertyDescription[2] had a Variants passed ByVal, both PROPVARIANT and VB Variant resulted in "Object does not support this action" crash
-(Bug fix) IPropertyStoreCapabilities.IsPropertyWritable was a Sub (HRESULT) but depended on the return; changed to Long



(oleexp v4.3 - Released 11 Sep 2017)
-Added interfaces IObjectWithFolderEnumMode, IApplicationDocumentLists, IFilterCondition, IItemFilter.
-Added interface set IRelatedItem, IIdentityName, IDelegateItem, ICurrentItem, ITransferMediumItem, IUseToBrowseItem, IDisplayItem, IViewStateIdentityItem, and IPreviewItem
-IContextMenu and IContextMenu2: .InvokeCommand has been changed to a Long, so that both CMINVOKECOMMANDINFO and CMINVOKECOMMANDINFOEX can be used. Use VarPtr(yourcommandinfovar) instead of just yourcommandinfovar.
-Added all structs, enums, and APIs for Shell Change Notify functions. For flags, Unicode is default- SHCNF_PATH = SHCNFPATHW, SHCNF_PRINTER = SHCNF_PRINTERW.
-(mIID) All IIDs for new interfaces.
-(mIID) Added FreeKnownFolderDefinitionFields macro for IKnownFolder type
-Bug fix: ITransferSource had the last 2 members truncated.
-Bug fix (mIID): IContextMenu and IContextMenu2 were, unbelievably, not right. How this was overlooked I have no idea. Apologies.
-Bug fix (mIID): IsEqualIID is now working; it wasn't aliased to IsEqualGUID.



(oleexp v4.2 - Released 01 Mar 2017)
-Added interfaces from NETCONLib/Netcon.idl. The existing Windows typelib was very incomplete and used types that would lead to automation errors.
-Netcon set:  IEnumNetConnection, INetConnection, INetConnectionManager, INetConnectionConnectUi, IEnumNetSharingPortMapping, INetSharingPortMapping, IEnumNetSharingEveryConnection, IEnumNetSharingPublicConnection, IEnumNetSharingPrivateConnection, IEnumNetConnection, INetConnection, INetConnectionManager, INetConnectionConnectUi, IEnumNetSharingPortMapping, INetSharingPortMapping, INetSharingPortMappingProps, INetSharingPortMapping, IEnumNetSharingEveryConnection, IEnumNetSharingPublicConnection, IEnumNetSharingPrivateConnection, INetSharingPortMappingCollection, INetConnectionProps, INetSharingConfiguration, INetSharingEveryConnectionCollection, INetSharingPublicConnectionCollection, INetSharingPrivateConnectionCollection, INetSharingManager
-Some interfaces with Windows implementations that are never or rarely implemented in VB now have members that are functions instead of subs so the HRESULT's are available. This change was made with IFileOperation, IShellLibrary, IShellLinkDataList, and IExplorerBrowser.
-Added missing struct members to SHELLEXECUTEINFO that for some reason were in SHELLEXECUTEINFO2. The latter will remain for compatibility.
-Added enums SE_ERR_x, ASSOCCLASS; structs ASSOCIATIONELEMENT
-Added additional API declares
-Added all structs, enums, and APIs for Shell_NotifyIcon
-Added additional interface for coclass ProgressDialog, IOperationsProgressDialog
-Added API SHGetSetSettings and related enum SSF_ constants and SHELLSTATE struct
-Added FILE_FLAG_ values to FILE_ATTRIBUTES enum
-(mIID) Updated with netcon interface IIDs



(oleexp v4.11 - Released 29 Dec 2016)
-Added interface IPolicyConfig/IPolicyConfigVista with coclass PolicyConfigClient/CPolicyConfigVistaClient; these are undocumented interfaces for managing audio devices. The former is for Windows 7 and higher, 
-(Bug fix) IShellItemFilter.GetItemEnumFlags changed from out to in,out so it can be used with Implements



(oleexp v4.1 - Released 01 Dec 2016)
-Added interfaces IFileSystemBindData and IFileSystemBindData2
-Added interface IObjectWithFolderEnumMode and related enum FOLDER_ENUM_MODE
-Added all known string parameters for IBindCtx as of Win10; e.g. STR_BIND_FOLDER_ENUM_MODE. See module BindCtxSTR to view them all.
-Added enums ASSOC_FILTER and SHIL
-Added a large number of shell32 APIs that are commonly used with the interfaces in oleexp. For a complete list, see the shell32 module in the Object Browser.
-Added a few additional APIs to ole32, kernel32 and shlwapi modules as well.
-(Bug fix) IThumbnailCache.GetThumbnailByID cannot pass user type byval, changed to ByRef. Verified working.
-(Bug fix) IFolderFilter is primarily used with Implements, but had an out-only parameter. Changed to in,out.



(oleexp v4.0 - Released 24 Nov 2016)
-Added interfaces IThumbnailCache, IThumbnailSettings, and ISharedBitmap. Added coclasses LocalThumbnailCache and SharedBitmap. Added associated enums WTS_FLAGS, WTS_CACHEFLAGS, WTS_CONTEXTFLAGS, and struct WTS_THUMBNAILID.

-Added SysCommands enum (SC_ values; SC_CLOSE, SC_MINIMIZE, etc)
-FILEOPENDIALOGOPTIONS enum was missing FOS_SUPPORTSTREAMABLEITEMS
-Bug fix: Some features listed as included in 3.8 weren't in the release posted.
-(mIID) Added all IIDs for new interfaces
-(mIID) Added all known other SID_ values




(oleexp v3.8 - Released 29 Sept 2016)
-Added all interfaces for Portable Devices
-IPortableDeviceConnector / IEnumPortableDeviceConnectors have been placed in oleexpimp.tlb, since IPortableDeviceConnector has the same UUID as IPortableDevice, so these cannot be placed in the same TLB.
-Given the context and scope expansion, olelib2 has been forked into oleexpImp. This TLB has a new UUID and a version number of 2.00. You may run a Replace All in your code to change 'olelib2.' to 'oleexpimp.'
-Added several enums for IImageList/IImageList2
-Added enum DATAOBJ_GET_ITEM_FLAGS
-Added enum NTSTATUS with all codes from ntstatus.h
-(oleexpimp) Changed IEnumString params to ByVal. CopyMemory calls to the pointers cause an app crash if it's done ByRef as the original SDK version is.
-Bug fix: Enum PIDISM contained a typo that created 'z' as a global constant. This is not part of the enum and has been removed.
-Bug fix: (oleexpimp) For some reason, in the original olelib the Implements version of IEnumIDList was in olelib.tlb, and the version in olelib2.tlb could not be used with Implements. Prior to this release neither could be used as the original def was changed but the olelib2 def wasn't; it has been now. Use 'Implements oleexpimp.IEnumIDList'. The 'Next' method has been changed to no retval, so pceltFetched is an argument and it's a sub. A sample published had done it with that as the retval, but the eliminates being able to vtable-swap to determine when the enum is finished.
-Bug fix: (oleexpimp) Something similar occured with IShellFolder. The Implements version is now also in oleexpimp.tlb, and CompareIDs has been changed from function to sub. All other methods set up as Functions using retval remain unchanged at this point.
-(NEW INCLUSION) Edanmo also put out a TLB for MIME, and it imported olelib. So as with olelib2, it has been recompiled against the latest version of oleexp3.tlb, so it can now be used without needing the legacy olelib.tlb. No intentional changes were made, but as the source was unpublished it was neccessary to use source generated by OLEVIEW. The new mimelib.tlb was assigned a new GUID and version number so it will not conflict with the old one. Please report any bugs.
-(mIID) All IID_'s for the new Portable Device interfaces have been added to mIID.
-(mIID) Removed IID_ShellDetails; this was the fmtid for some file info PKEYs and shouldn't have been included like a COM interface. IID_IShellDetails is the shell interface; this was already included and is the proper one to use for QueryInterface.
-(mIID) Around a dozen missing IIDs were added as they had been formatted different and the conversion script missed them.



(oleexp v3.7 - Released 13 Jul 2016)
-Added DirectShow support. All interfaces under 'DirectShow Interfaces' on MSDN Library. NOTE: DirectShow interfaces are entirely untested at this point. Please provide feedback!
---New addon mDirectShow.bas containing IID's that are exclusively used by DirectShow.
-Fixed data structure for IMMNotificationClient. The PKEY is passed in a very unusual way and must be dealt with in an even more unusual way, so please see Core Audio Basics demo project for usage technique.
---This is currently an open issue. IAudioEndpointVolumeCallback is declared as a ByVal passed struct that uses a GUID, however the normal technique of changing it to ByRef for VB works fine here. Please notify me of any issues with this or other callback interfaces.
-Added fairly comprehensive enum for WM_ constants (WindowMessages)-- should be all the official ones, and complete enums WS_ constants (WindowStyles), and WS_EX_ constants (WindowStylesEx)
-Added missing flags for EXPLORER_BROWSER_OPTIONS (IExplorerBrowser)
-Unhid some functions of the ShellWindows object. Events are still hidden; you can remove the hidden tag and recompile. Registration functions and FindWindowSW are now shown.
-Added ShellWindowFindWindowOptions enum for IShellWindows.FindWindowSW
-mIID now includes IID's for all interfaces (besides the specialized ones for CoreAudio/DirectShow which are still in the addon modules for those features)
---Due to irregularities in the format of interface defs in a few parts of the original olelib set, the automated tool I made might have missed something or truncated a letter. I've done my best to clean it all up, but if anything is missing/wrong please notify me!



(oleexp v3.6 - Released 16 May 2016)
-Added CoreAudio support. Currently all interfaces under the 'Core Audio Interfaces' list on MSDN have been added, and a few additional related interfaces. See https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd370805%28v=vs.85%29.aspx for a complete list. Structures and enums also added.
-A support addon, mCoreAudio.bas, has also been created containing IID_ entries for all Core Audio interfaces, several additional GUID's used, and several PKEYs. 
-Some PROPERTYKEY and IID_ entries also used outside just Core Audio have been added to mPKEY.bas and mIID.bas



(oleexp v3.51 - Released 9 May 2016)
-Critical bugfix for IShellLinkDataList; CopyDataBlock caused an unsupported automation type error due to an incorrect declare.
-Added enum and structs for IShellLinkDataList datablocks; see SHELL_LINK_DATABLOCK_SIG enum, structs: DATABLOCK_HEADER, NT_CONSOLE_PROPS, NT_FE_CONSOLE_PROPS, EXP_DARWIN_LINK, EXP_SPECIAL_FOLDER, EXP_SZ_LINK, EXP_PROPERTYSTORAGE.



(oleexp v3.5 - Released 25 Apr 2016)
-Restored interface IFolderFilter... somehow, this interface got commented out in the copy of olelib that oleexp started from. Very odd.
-Added interface IAutoCompleteDropDown
-Added interface IStartMenuPinnedList
-Added interface IDataObjectAsyncCapability (formerly IAsyncOperation; implementation details are different too; see old in shell.inc vs new in exp_main.odl)
-Added interface IObjMgr
-Added interface IShellLinkDataList
-Added interface IInitializeWithBindCtx
-Bugfix and update to InvokeCommandMask enum. CMIC_MASK_CONTROL_DOWN should be 0x40000000. Uncommented undocumented entries. Added newer flags.
-Associated InvokeCommandMask with CMINVOKECOMMANDINFO.lpParameters
-(mIID) Optional add-on mIID.bas updated to include IID_IContextMenu, IID_IContextMenu2, and IID_IContextMenu3
-(mIID) Optional add-on mIID.bas now includes all KNOWNFOLDER (e.g. FOLDERID_Documents) UUIDs in ready-to-use form.
-Added KF_FLAG_DEFAULT (0x00000000) to KNOWN_FOLDER_FLAG enum
-Updated WIN32_FIND_DATAA/W to use FILE_ATTRIBUTES enum for easy use with intellisense
-Updated the following enums to include all new values through Windows 10: QueryContextMenuFlags, SHCONTF, IEIFlags, SHCOLSTATE, ASSOCSTR, ASSOCF, ASSOCDATA, SHACF, FOLDERFLAGS, SLR_FLAGS, SLGP_FLAGS, FILE_ATTRIBUTES, CATEGORYINFO_FLAGS, ARCONTENT, SPBEGINF, SPACTION, WALLPAPEROPT, PROGDLG, SHELLEXECUTEMASK, GILFlags, GILRes, PSP_FLAGS, PSPCALLBACKMESSAGES, PSNOTIFYCODES, PSNOTIFYRESULTS, PSWIZBUTTONS, PSMESSAGES, QITipFlags, FILEOP_FLAGS, AUTOCOMPLETEOPTIONS, AUTOCOMPLETELISTOPTIONS, SVSI_Flags, SVGIO_Flags, OLECMDID, URLACTIONS, PUAF, URLTEMPLATE, ZAFLAGS, PROPSETFLAG, BINDSTRING, HTTP_QUERY, STATURL_QUERYFLAGS, STATURLFLAGS, IURL_INVOKECOMMAND_FLAGS, PID_IS, PID_INTSITE, BINDINFO_OPTIONS, BSCF, BINDSTATUS, CLSCTX, MSHCTX, FD_FLAGS, WBIDM, TYPEFLAGS, TASK_FLAGS



(oleexp v3.4 - Released 10 Jan 2016)
-Added interface IShellWindows with coclass ShellWindows
-Added interfaces IFolderView2, IFolderViewOptions and IFolderViewSettings
-Added interface IResolveShellLink
-Added several additional rarely used clipboard format strings (CFSTR_xxx)
-(ORIGINAL OLELIB2 CONTENT CHANGE) oleexp modified some interfaces that are used with Implements which were in the original olelib (and not olelib2). olelib2 has been modified to include Implements-compatible versions of IShellBrowser, IShellView, IShellView2, and IShellFolder2.
-(ORIGINAL OLELIB CONTENT CHANGE) Wanted to add standard compiler flag #define CALLCONV CC_STDCALL, and this required renaming the CALLCONV enum to CALLCONV_TYPES. The variables and their values are unchanged. If you have declared a variable 'As CALLCONV', change to 'As CALLCONV_TYPES'.
-Bugfix: SSDP enum duplicated improperly named BO_Flags. IExplorerBrowser now uses BO_Flags (only important if you had Dim x As SDSP); added missing values to BO_Flags.



(oleexp v3.3 - Released 03 Dec 2015)
-Added interface IPreviewHandlerVisuals; this allows fixing the bug where previewing fonts with IPreviewHandler just showed black boxes (see updated IPreviewHandler sample project for details).
-Added interface IPreviewHandlerFrame
-Added interface IVisualProperties
-Added interfaces IShellApp, IPublishedApp, IPublishedApp2, IEnumPublishedApps, and IAppPublisher. 
-Added interfaces IShellIconOverlay and IShellIconOverlayIdentifier
-Added several additional CFSTR_ dragdrop/clipboard formats, and moved CFSTR_MIME_x formats to exp_cf.odl with the rest.
-Added DRAGDRAG_E_x and DRAGDROP_S_x HRESULTs to dragdrop defs module
====
Note: The following interfaces were added in v3.2 but were missing from this file:
-ICommDlgBrowser, ICommDlgBrowser2, ICommDlgBrowser3
-IApplicationAssociationRegistration, IApplicationAssociationRegistrationUI
-IShellFolderViewCB
-IStreamAsync
-IColumnManager



(oleexp v3.2 - Released 10 Nov 2015)
-Added interface IEnumFullIDList.
-Added enum for IInternetSecurityMananger::MapURLToZone flags.
-Added coclass for IInternetSecurityManager's default implementation
-Changed IShellItemArray.BindToHandler's IBindCtx argument to a long; can pass ObjPtr(bindctx) if actually using it.
-Added comprehensive enum of clipboard formats. Some of these are strings, so these were added as consts in a module rather than a typical enum
-Added regular enums: all VK_ codes as VirtualKeyCodes, all SW_ codes as SHOWWINDOW, DROPIMAGETYPES
-Added DROPDESCRIPTION structure
-Updated HRESULTS enum to include NOERROR
-Bug fix: Removed RemoteNext from IEnumShellItems;  it's not a true entry and would throw off the v-table order, rendering Skip, Reset, and Clone inoperable. Fortunely those are rarely used, but just in case they're now fixed. Verified no other interface has a Remote included.
-Bug fix: IShellImageDataAbort had IUnknown methods visible; particularly problematic since it's implement-only and you don't want to also have to implement IUnknown. This has been corrected.



(oleexp v3.1 - Released 18 Sep 2015)
-FOLDERVIEWMODE and FOLDERFLAGS enums updated with new entries and moved to revisedtypes.odl
-Bug Fix: IKnownFolderManager; fixed user-type byvals in a couple places, converted strings that expected paths to LONG for Unicode support (use StrPtr), and removed invalid RemoteRedirect entry.
-Added interfaces IImageList and IImageList2. There is a default implementation coclass, but it must be created via ImageList_CoCreateInstance API, the normal coclass declaration/As New method fails. IImageList, but not IImageList2, is all Subs instead of error-code returning Long functions- this was done because IImageList is also made to be implemented in a class module as a callback object set in IImageList2.
-Added additional interfaces for working with the Property Storage system: IPropertyStoreCache, IPropertyStoreCapabilities, IPropertyStoreFactory, IPropertyDescriptionSearchInfo, and IPropertyDescriptionRelatedPropertyInfo.
-Added interface IParentAndItem; more easily keep track of a parent pidl and child pidl.
-Added interface IImageRecompress with coclass ImageRecompress.
-Added interface IImageTranscode with coclass ImageTranscode.
-Added interface IThumbnailHandlerFactory
-Added interface IShellImageDataFactory, IShellImageData and IShellImageDataAbort, with coclass ShellImageDataFactory.
-Added interface ISearchFolderItemFactory with coclass SearchFolderItemFactory and interfaces it depends on: IRichChunk, ICondition, ICondition2, and IConditionFactory/IConditionFactory2 with coclass ConditionFactory.
-Added interface IPreviousVersionsInfo with coclass PreviousVersions.
-Added interface ISearchBoxInfo.
-Added interface IZoneIdentifier with coclass PersistentZoneIdentifier.
-Added enums/structs that are common for shell programming; FILE_ATTRIBUTES values, STGFMT and STGOPTIONS (IStorage related), 



(oleexp v3.01 - Released 14 Aug 2015)
-Bug Fix: INamespaceTreeControlEvents gave an 'bad interface for implements' error; this was due to a missed explicit typing of olelib.IUnknown. Attempted to change to oleexp3.IUnknown; but that's inexplicable not recognized. So left it as LPVOID; should not make a difference, and stops the error. Checked for similar errors; could not find any. However, a larger error exists regarding OnBeforeContextMenu and OnAfterContextMenu, and the control will crash on right clicking a folder. This was the case originally and I missed it; I do not currently know how to fix it.



(oleexp v3.0 - Released 10 Aug 2015)
-oleexp is now a single project. It's now a direct fork/derivative of olelib, and no longer an expansion. It has been assigned a new GUID, meaning that VB sees it as a new typelib, not a version of previous ones. Minor code changes are required, but simple: replace all 'olelib.' and 'oleexp.' with 'oleexp3.', assuming you had any such explicit typing.
-Source files are still separated; oleexp.odl was modified to include all of olelib's .inc files before its own.
-To use, remove references for olelib.tlb and oleexp.tlb, then add a reference to oleexp3.tlb
-Added newer values to shlwapi.inc ASSOCSTR enum in original olelib.
-Added interface IPreviewHandler
-Added interface group IInitializeFromFile, IInitializeFromStream, and IInitializeFromItem



(oleexp v2.0 - Released 17 Jun 2015)
-IMPORTANT: Made change to original olelib: IShellView, IShellView2, and IShellBrowser had major issues, largest among them a riid, ppv was returning a Long as a retval! Other trying interfaces as retvals, inheritance issues, etc. IShellView, IShellView2, IShellBrowser and related enums have been moved to oleexp and corrected.
-Added interface IShellView3
-Added interface set ITransferSource, ITransferDesination, ITransferAdviseSink, IShellItemResources, IEnumResources
-Added interface set IKnownFolder, IKnownFolderManager with KnownFolderManager coclass
-Added interface set IExplorerBrowser, IExplorerBrowserEvents with ExplorerBrowser coclass
-Added interface set INameSpaceTreeControl, INameSpaceTreeControl2, INameSpaceTreeControlEvents, INameSpaceTreeControlDropHandler, INameSpaceTreeControlAccessible, INameSpaceTreeControlCustomDraw, INameSpaceTreeControlFolderCapabilities with NamespaceTreeControl coclass
-IShellFolder2 had been declared independently instead of inheriting from IShellFolder. Many of the methods for returning other interfaces (GetUIObjectOf, etc) were incorrectly declared as long. Considered changing, but instead removed all the IShellFolder methods and gave it proper inheritance. The IShellFolder interface it inherits is the new, corrected oleexp one. The previous entries are present in the source but commented out if needed for reference or to switch back.
-IShellFolder.BindToStorage stood out as the only method not able to return an HRESULT code; changed from Sub to Function.
-IShellItem.BindToHandler IBindCtx argument was changed to Long. A bind context is rarely used, so the requirement to make and pass a blank one has been eliminated. If you do use one, you can pass ObjPtr(yourbindctx).
-IShellItemImageFactory has finally been fixed. MSDN and SHobjIdl.idl both confirm 1st argument as SIZE, and typedef struct SIZE {LONG cx, LONG xy} SIZE; Double checked olelib def, it's correct. However, changing it into two parameters, [in] LONG cx, [in] LONG cy , has fixed it. Truly bizarre, especially on account of my C++ workaround using a SIZE struct, but glad to have it working.
-Bug Fix: In IShellFolder2 where GetDefaultSearchGUID failed with unsupported automation type error.
-Bug Fix: 'cannot pass user type byval' in IFileDialog.SetClientGuid
-Bug Fix: IFileDialog.GetFileName was returning blank or giving out of memory error. This should be a Long, not a string, and then converted to a string with BStrFromLPWStr.
-Bug Fix: IPropertyStore: GetValue had a 'can't pass user type byval error', SetValue had the reverse problem (is now ByVal VARIANT) and other methods were left 'as any' and have been changed to VARIANT. Even though that's a native type, PropVariantToVariant may be needed to convert it into something usable.
-Bug Fix: 'cannot pass user type byval' in IObjectWithPropertyKey
-Bug Fix: IPropertyChange and IPropertyChangeArray (PROPVARIANT->VARIANT and byval user types)



(oleexp v1.9 - Released 11 Jun 2015)
-IMPORTANT: Made change to original olelib: Type FORMATETC had .cfFormat as a short (Integer), but RegisterClipboardFormat returns values exceeding the range of VB's signed integer. There is no unsigned integer type so this has been changed to LONG. Slight code changes may be required for anything using this type. **Please notify me of any incompatibilities ASAP**
-Added interfaces IDropTargetHelper, IDragSourceHelper, IDragSourceHelper2. These are all createable through the DragDropHelper class, Dim idsh As IDragSourceHelper : Set idsh = New DragDropHelper
-Related SHDRAGIMAGE struct added
-Added ShellLibrary coclass so IShellLibrary can be created with New instead of CoCreateInstance



(oleexp v1.8 - Released 01 Jun 2015)
-Added interfaces IPropertySystem, IPropertyDescription, IPropertyDescription2 and associated enums
-Major bugfixes: Multiple interfaces had rarely used methods that returned other interfaces declared incorrectly. IShellItem, IShellItem2, IShellItemArray, IShellLibrary, IPropertyChangeArray, ICustomDestinationList¹, IPropertyDescriptionList, and IShellMenu were all effected by this- all methods with riid As UUID, ppv As Any had their definitions changed. This fixed the "Interface marked as restricted or automation type not supported" errors. If you weren't getting that error on the specified interfaces, this error does not effect you and the changes won't require any recoding.
¹- Stil not working.



(oleexp v1.71 - Released 31 May 2015)
-I believe the PROPVARIANT structure as included is wholly useless as applied to IShellItem2.GetProperty; this has been changed to return a Variant. Since these types are similar; a Variant can apparently hold a PROPVARIANT well enough to be passed to the PropVariantToVariant API and return something useful, like a thumbnail stream with the vbDataObject type.



(oleexp 1.7 - Released 04 May 2015)
-New interfaces for IUserNotification2 added. Does not alter original olelib's version, a new coclass is provided and exists together with the original.
-Attempted to fix SMDATA structure, but not yet tested.
-No backwards compatibility issues.



(oleexp 1.6 - Released 03 Apr 2015)
-New interfaces for the MenuBar and Association Handlers added
-No changes effecting anything in prior versions



(oleexp 1.41 - Released 30 Jan 2015)
-All IShellItem, IShellItem2, and ICustomDestinationList calls are now functions in order to receive their HRESULT returns
-IShellItem2 PROPERTYKEY arguments needed to be byref
-Attempted to redefine PROPVARIANT to at least get longs working, but still fails, despite functions receiving it where a PROPVARIANT receiving a long is expected returning an S_OK hr. I suspect this issue to be the cause of all attempts at using ICustomDestinationList failing.


(oleexp 1.4 - Released 21 Jan 2015)
-SHELLDETAILS struct now in oleexp instead of olelib
-IShellFolder2 interface converted to return HRESULT for all functions. All other outputs are now parameters, and all subs are now functions.
-IPropertyStore calls requiring PROPVARIANT type: changed to void* (As Any) to allow multiple data types by being able to declare PROPVARIANTSTR, PROPVARIANTBOOL, etc within VB and not being restricted to a single type defined in the typelib. Also, SetValue and Commit are now functions returning an HRESULT code. UNDER DEVELOPMENT: Only limited confirmation of whether it's working.
-IObjectArray GetCount and GetAt are now functions returning an HRESULT code.
-ICustomDestionationList AddUserTasks now a function returning an HRESULT. UNDER DEVELOPMENT: I have not gotten this interface to work yet, so it's subject to heavy revision.



(oleexp 1.1-1.3 - Released 17 Jan 2015) ...Individual revision history lost.
-Added interface IModalWindow
-Added interface IFileOperationProgressSink
-Added interface set IFileDialog, IFileDialog2, IFileDialogEvents, IFileDialogCustomize, IFileDialogControlEvents, IFileOpenDialog with coclass FileOpenDialog, and IFileSaveDialog with coclass FileSaveDialog.
-Added interface IShellItemFilter
-Added interface IPropertyDescriptionList
