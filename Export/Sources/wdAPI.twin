 *
 * (2) Send a SELECTIONADD notification when a new item has simply been added
 *     to the selection within a container.  This is appropriate when the
 *     number of newly selected items is very small.  hwnd + ID is the
 *     container control, idChildItem is the new child added to the selection.
 *
 * (3) Send a SELECTIONREMOVE notification when a new item has simply been
 *     removed from the selection within a container.  This is appropriate
 *     when the number of newly selected items is very small, just like
 *     SELECTIONADD.  hwnd + ID is the container control, idChildItem is the
 *     new child removed from the selection.
 *
 * (4) Send a SELECTIONWITHIN notification when the selected items within a
 *     control have changed substantially.  Rather than propagate a large
 *     number of changes to reflect removal for some items, addition of
 *     others, just tell somebody who cares that a lot happened.  It will
 *     be faster an easier for somebody watching to just turn around and
 *     query the container control what the new bunch of selected items
