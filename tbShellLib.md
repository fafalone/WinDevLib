### ***tbShellLib is now WinDevLib - Windows Development Library for twinBASIC***
This project has grown well beyond it's original mission of shell programming. While that's still the largest single part, it's no longer a majority of the code, and the name change now much better reflects the purpose of providing a general Windows API experience like windows.h. Compiler constants and module names/file names have been updated to reflect the name change. tbShellLibImpl is now WinDevLibImpl. There are also some major chanages associated with this update, please see the full changelog below.
